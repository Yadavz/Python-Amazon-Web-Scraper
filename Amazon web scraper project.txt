The Amazon Web Scraper project is a Python program that extracts the title and price of a specific product from Amazon India and saves it to a CSV file. It uses the Beautiful Soup library for web scraping and the Pandas library for data analysis. The program can be customized to extract data for any product on Amazon India by changing the URL of the product. The program also includes automation to monitor the price of the product over time. The project can be further improved by adding features such as email alerts when the price of a product falls below a certain threshold or using machine learning to predict the future prices of a product based on historical data.
